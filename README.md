RSNA 2013 LL-INE-3216 ID#13019747 Dictation Device code


Place holder for source code!

I will put up my xcode project file and arduino sketches once I figure out the license issues for the redpark serial library and images (all but one image had an "open" license, like CC, but, that still requires that I put a copy of that license here or something...)

Do be warned that this is probably the worst code I've ever written; it was written as a demo, not for production...and I'm a doctor, not a real programmer!
